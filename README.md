# AI.veristacks: A Decentralized Gemini Chat Application

A modern, blockchain-powered chat application that integrates Google's Gemini AI with the Stacks blockchain for secure, verifiable conversations. The application allows users to chat with an AI, then immutably save a hash of their conversation to the Stacks blockchain, providing a permanent and verifiable record of the exchange.

## Live Demo

You can try out the live application deployed on Vercel:

**[https://logging-chat-stacks.vercel.app/](https://logging-chat-stacks.vercel.app/)**

## Features

- **AI Chat Interface**: Powered by Google's Gemini AI for intelligent and responsive conversations.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Save and verify chat exchanges on the Stacks blockchain using a Clarity smart contract.
- **Wallet Connection**: Seamlessly connect with Stacks-compatible wallets like Leather, Hiro, and Xverse.
- **Multi-Chat Management**: Create, switch between, rename, and delete multiple chat instances.
- **Secure & Private**: Conversations are hashed before being stored on-chain, ensuring the content remains private while the record is verifiable.
- **Transaction Logs**: View a history of your saved conversation hashes directly from the blockchain.
- **Responsive Design**: A modern, mobile-friendly interface built with Next.js, shadcn/ui, and Tailwind CSS.

## How It Works & Data Flow

The application provides a seamless flow from chatting with an AI to creating an immutable, verifiable record on the Stacks blockchain.

1. **User Interaction**: The user chats with the Gemini AI through the frontend interface.
2. **Hashing**: When a user decides to save an exchange, the frontend uses the Web Crypto API (`crypto.subtle.digest`) to generate a **SHA-256 hash** of both the user's prompt and the AI's response. This ensures the actual conversation content remains private.
3. **Contract Call**: The application calls the `log-interaction` public function of the `logger.clar` smart contract, passing the two generated hashes as arguments.
4. **Transaction Signing**: The user is prompted by their Stacks wallet (e.g., Leather) to sign and approve the transaction, which incurs a small network fee.
5. **On-Chain Storage**: The smart contract receives the hashes and stores them in a `map` data structure. It links the hashes to the user's Stacks principal (`tx-sender`) and a unique, auto-incrementing ID for that user. It also records the `block-timestamp` of the transaction.
6. **Loading & Verification**: To view logs or verify an exchange, the frontend uses read-only contract calls to `get-user-log-count` and `get-log` functions, fetching the stored hashes for the connected user's address.

## Smart Contract Details

The core blockchain logic is handled by the `logger.clar` smart contract.

- **`user-log-count` Map**: A map that stores a `uint` counter for each user `principal`, tracking the total number of logs they have saved.
- **`logs` Map**: The primary data storage. It maps a tuple containing a `user` principal and a log `id` to a tuple containing the `prompt-hash`, `response-hash`, and `block-timestamp`.
- **`log-interaction` Public Function**: The main entry point for writing data. It takes a `prompt-hash` and a `response-hash` as `buff 32` arguments. It retrieves the current user's log count, uses it as the new ID, and saves the log data. Finally, it increments the user's log count.
- **`get-log` Read-Only Function**: Retrieves a specific log for a given `user` and `id`.
- **`get-user-log-count` Read-Only Function**: Returns the total number of logs for a given `user`.
